# Guitar Ear Trainer (Godot) 🎸

A powerful, fretboard-centric ear training application built with **Godot Engine 4.x**. This tool is designed specifically for guitarists to bridge the gap between abstract music theory and its physical implementation on the fretboard.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Interval Training (with Shape Focus)
- Learn to recognize intervals not just by sound, but by their visual **shapes** on the guitar.
- **Fixed Pos Mode**: Keep the root note consistent to master 1-to-1 relationships between patterns and intervals (e.g., Major 3rd as a 'small diagonal').
- **Cadence Context**: Plays a full I-IV-V-I cadence before each quiz to firmly establish the key in your ear.

### 2. Chord Progression Quiz
- Master functional harmony by identifying common diatonic progressions (I, IV, V, vi, etc.).
- Innovative **Slot-based UI** to track multi-step progressions.
- Answer directly on the fretboard to reinforce position-based thinking.

### 3. Chord Quality & Location
- Distinguish between Major, Minor, Diminished, and Dominant chords.
- Practice finding specific chord voicings across the neck.
- Supports **Guitar Form (CAGED/Drop)** and **Theory** voicing modes.

### 4. Melody Sequencer
- Integrated sequencer to record, edit, and play back melodies.
- Visual note feedback and synchronized audio.
